Swirl (wine and cheese) is to my left and FairGrinds (coffee shop) is to my right and the neighborhood itself is again filled with the people and a vivacity that is resilient beyond my comprehension.</p><p>Our main objective at Lux is to provide a space for relaxation and personal care that is comfortable and welcoming.   We offer lovely services and treatments in a personable and friendly environment and seek to develop long term relationships with our customers.  Caring for yourself is not complicated and we strive to illustrate that notion.  Our services are crafted specifically for you, because YOU are one of a kind.</p><p>We are delighted to be here and hope that you will stop in and check out our sweet, little spa for yourself!</p><p>Many thanks and we hope to see you soon!</p><p>Erin Peacock<br />Owner</p> </div></div></div><div class="contactinfo"><?php include 'contactinfo.php'; ?></div></div></div></div></div><div class="footer"></div></body></html>
